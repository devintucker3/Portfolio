                    </header>
                        <p>I've had the luxury of dabbling in many professions, including running my own landscaping business. Overtime, as a result, I began to understand the need for a presence on the web in all of them. I look forward to working on the other side of that need and building my knowledge of web-based development.</p>
                        <p>Currently attending the Software Engineering Immersion Bootcamp at Thinkful, and learning so much everyday the more I dive into it all! So much to learn which is exciting! (Also, a little terrifying.)</p>
                        <p>This career path wouldn't be worth it if I didn't get to work with aspiring software developers like myself, and am thankful everyday for the opportunity to chat and/or work with people like myself. Reach out to me if interested in collaborating!!</p>
